# Pinned per service, by digest. A digest names one artifact and cannot move
# underneath a running service, so staging runs the build that was promoted
# rather than whatever a rolling tag points at when a task restarts.
#
# Seeded from the digests dev ran when staging was created. Later versions
# arrive by merging the "Promote dev's images to staging" pull request, which
# scripts/promote.sh keeps open; each digest carries linux/arm64, which the
# tasks run on.
#
# The blank lines between the pins are what keeps two services' bumps from
# conflicting. Each bump rewrites one line, and git conflicts on changes to
# adjacent lines, so six consecutive pins made every pair of open bump pull
# requests a conflict waiting for the second one to merge.
