# Pinned per service, by digest. A digest names one artifact and cannot move
# underneath a running service, so what dev runs is what was merged rather than
# whatever a rolling tag pointed at when a task last restarted.
#
# These are the manifest indexes each repository's `main` tag pointed at when
# the stage was first brought up. Each carries linux/arm64, which the tasks run
# on. Bump one by reading the digest its tag now names:
#
#   crane digest ghcr.io/fil-forge/sprue:main
#
# The blank lines between the pins are what keeps two services' bumps from
# conflicting. Each bump rewrites one line, and git conflicts on changes to
# adjacent lines, so six consecutive pins made every pair of open bump pull
# requests a conflict waiting for the second one to merge.
